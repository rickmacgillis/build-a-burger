# Build-A-Burger

Build-A-Burger is a burger-creation interface similar to what you might find at a restaurant. I built it to showcase my ability to write React.js applications.

## Important!
Please note that any exclusively-browser-side code that tries to authenticate with a third-party service is inherently insecure. This project, along with any other exclusively browser-side code I place in my account, are only meant to be there as a demonstration of my skillset in the given technology. Please DO NOT use these in a production environment without implementing your own backend code to properly handle authentication and other information that needs to stay secure.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
